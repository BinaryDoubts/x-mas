EMERGENCY BRIEFING
Delivered to the assembled command staff at Sinterklaas Base, North Pole

Gentlemen,

At 0800 NPT (North Pole Time) today, SF1 (Santa Force 1) was shot out of the sky during codename RUBY WHITE's routine pre-Christmas test flight over the Icelandic island of Danskfjord. At this time, RUBY WHITE is believed to be alive but in critical condition. The OPFOR are suspected to be members of GRINCH Squad, acting under orders from the island's owner, reclusive industrialist Darrow Vanderhoof IV.

To put it plainly: we don't have much time. Christmas is tomorrow, and without RUBY WHITE's recovery, we may be looking at a cataclysmic loss of holiday spirit across all channels. We're down to the wire, and I'm afraid there's only one choice: re-activate the Merrymaking Activity Squad. Yes, I know the team was mothballed for good reasons, but in this case, we need the best.

Once the team is reassembled, we will depart for Danskfjord aboard SF2 immediately. There is no time for our usual mission prep: this will be a blitz to the heart of the island to rescue RUBY WHITE.

If we fail, Christmas may never be the same again. Consider this my official command to reactivate the X-M.A.S. May God have mercy on our souls. 

THIS CHRISTMAS SEASON
The X-M.A.S. in
RED SLED DOWN

1142 - Icelandic settlers discover a remote island in the Arctic Ocean. It is named Danskfjord, or "Suicide Cliffs." Locals avoid the island, fearing it to be cursed.
1921 - Eccentric industrialist Darrow P. Vanderhoof notices the unmarked island on a map of the waters around his Arctic yacht. On a whim, he picks it as the test island for his concept Christmas village: Pine Breeze, A Merry Place to Live!
1947 - Construction is delayed for over a decade by Darrow's endless perfectionism and insistence on redesigning the subterranean areas himself. After WWII, a friendly senator loans Darrow a corps of Army engineers, which he uses to finally finish his Christmas utopia.
1953 - The village is shocked by an expose in the New York Times, which alleges that Vanderhoof Industries had covered up a number of health code violations and issues of substandard construction in Pine Breeze. Many victims with "snowflake lung," caused by the village's use of asbestos-containing fake snow, form a class action suit against Darrow. Surprisingly, only a small number of the plaintiffs choose to move out of the village, citing their personal "love for Christmas."
1961 - The final residents of the village are forced to leave after a spill of biological weapons (intended for the disposal vault on the island's north peak) renders the air and earth toxic to humans.
1972 - A CBS special report, "Christmas Village... Or Suicide Village?" briefly reignites interest in the island. Several made-for-TV movies are rushed into production, including one titled "I Left My Heart in the Breeze (Pine)," starring a then-unknown B-actor named Ronald Reagan.
1980 - A group of radical Icelandic and Norwegian artists, "Collectivø," lay claim to the abandoned island in an elaborate combination of performance art and property squatting. Within weeks, the entire group were found dead of causes unknown. A posthumous EP was published under the title "THE.VAULT.", based on recordings left by several of the group's artists before their demise.
1994 - The Norwegian PM declares that, based on Norway's interpretation of an old treaty, Danskfjord belongs to Norway. An indignant Iceland responds by forming a naval defensive perimeter around the island. In turn, Norway blockades the Icelandic blockade with their own.  After years of uneasy detente, the matter is settled amicably: both nations agree that neither should settle Danskfjord, instead declaring it a forbidden site with the intention of using the entire island as a chemical and nuclear waste dump.
2001 - Darrow J. Vanderhoof IV tenders an all-cash offer for the island to both nations (who never got around to using it anyway, plus it was 9/11 and everyone was busy). In a press release, Darrow declares he plans to "fulfill his father's vision." An army of workmen build a cutting-edge "smart mansion" at the heart of the decayed village, a walled compound from which Darrow has never left.
2018 - An increasingly-paranoid Darrow places the island on "permanent lockdown," enforced by a team of highly-paid mercenaries from GRINCH squad.
