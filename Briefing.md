*Emergency briefing delivered to the assembled command staff at Sinterklaas Base, North Pole.*

Gentlemen,

At 0800 NPT (North Pole Time) today, SF1 (Santa Force 1) was shot out of the sky during codename RUBY WHITE's routine pre-Christmas test flight over the Icelandic island of Danskfjord. At this time, RUBY WHITE is believed to be alive but in critical condition. The OPFOR are suspected to be members of GRINCH Squad, acting under orders from the island's owner, reclusive industrialist Darrow Vanderhoof IV.

To put it plainly: we don't have much time. Christmas is tomorrow, and without RUBY WHITE's recovery, we may be looking at a cataclysmic loss of holiday spirit across all channels. We're down to the wire, and I'm afraid there's only one choice: re-activate the Merrymaking Activity Squad. Yes, I know the team was mothballed for good reasons, but in this case, we need the best.

Once the team is reassembled, we will depart for Danskfjord aboard SF2 immediately. There is no time for our usual mission prep: this will be a blitz to the heart of the island to rescue RUBY WHITE.

If we fail, Christmas may never be the same again. Consider this my official command to reactivate the X-M.A.S. May God have mercy on our souls.
