## What Is This?
X-M.A.S. is a fast-paced action-movie roleplaying game about a team of elite Christmas operatives on a deadly mission to save Santa. Based on the FIST system, X-M.A.S. is optimized for quick play and merriment at your table. It's designed to be used alongside the RED SLED DOWN one-shot adventure, although the core rules can be used to play out any high-octane action story... as long as it's at least a little bit about saving Christmas.
