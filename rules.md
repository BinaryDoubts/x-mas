## Tests
To make a test, roll 2d6 and add them together with the relevant stat (either +Hammer or +Scalpel). Your outcome depends on the total rolled:
* **1-6: NAUGHTY.** You don’t do what you wanted to do, and things go wrong somehow. *You always fail on snake eyes regardless of how many bonuses you have to the roll.*
* **7-9: MOSTLY NICE.** You do what you wanted to, but with a cost, compromise, or complication.
* **10+: NICE.** You do exactly what you wanted to do, without any additional headaches.
* **12+: EXTRA NICE.** You do exactly what you wanted to do, with some spectacular added bonus.

Certifications and item tags can give you +1 to the roll if they're relevant. Each can only be used once per scene, though there's no limit on how many you can stack onto a single roll (as long as you can justify it in the narrative!)
## Combat
Firefights work like everything else, with Command directing the spotlight and the players deciding how they want to act. Failed rolls in combat will generally result in the player taking damage — enemies don't roll on their own to attack.

### Eliminations
Enemy targets have a fixed Pain Threshold. Damage dealt to them builds up until it equals or exceeds the Threshold, at which point they're taken out of the fight (either dead or unconscious, narrative depending). They may also have Armor, which reduces by 1 or 2 all incoming damage values (to a minimum of 1). *AP weapons ignore Armor.*
### One Shot, One Kill
Semi-automatic (SA) and single-fire weapons are more likely to hit life-critical areas on your targets. On an Extra Nice success (12+), deal double damage with your attack.
### Spray and Pray
Fully automatic (FA) weapons are perfect for engaging multiple adversaries at once. When you deal damage to a target that would "overflow" by exceeding their Pain Threshold, deal the remainder to another nearby target that you could plausibly switch your aim to. On an Extra Nice success (12+), deal +1 damage and freely distribute the total damage between any number of plausible targets, no overflow needed.
### Heavy Weapons
Once deployed, you can use your heavy weapon for the duration of a scene. After that, it's considered to be out of ammo unless you spend some Christmas Spirit (see below).

## Injuries
In the heat of battle, it can be hard to tell how hurt you are amidst the chaos and adrenaline. Any time operators take damage from an attack, they gain 1-3 Injury dice depending on the attack's severity. These dice are set aside until the fighting's over, at which point everyone with 1 or more Injuries must roll their personal pool of dice. After rolling, group them up by number to see how many lasting Wounds you take, looking only at the size of each group (the specific numbers rolled don't matter).
* Unmatched dice (group of 1): Just a graze! Discard the die and move on.
* Group of 2: Minor Wound, fill in 2 wound boxes
* Group of 3: Major Wound, fill in 3 wound boxes
* Group of 4: Massive Wound, fill in 4 wound boxes
* Groups of 5+: Mortal Wound, fill in all empty wound boxes (even if there's more than the group size left unfilled)

After filling in your wound boxes, give each group a name (e.g., punctured shoulder, lacerated arm, gut shot, broken foot, etc.) These can be used as negative tags to earn you Christmas Spirit (see below).
## Christmas Spirit
You begin the game with 3 Christmas Spirit. At any time, you can spend a Christmas Spirit to:
* On one roll, re-use any number of relevant, expended tags
* Find a cache of ammo to reload your Heavy Weapon
* Grant an ally (not yourself) a full re-roll after seeing the result. You must narrate how you assist them, and will take any consequences alongside them.

You can gain Christmas Spirit at Command's discretion or by fulfilling one of the conditions below:
- Roleplay your Guy Type to the hilt by making a suboptimal choice, putting yourself in danger, or just making everyone laugh
- Showing mercy, kindness, and/or the giving spirit to a friend or enemy
- Making your own life harder by suggesting a negative use for an item or wound tag to Command (earning you -1 on the roll).

Finally, if you ever restore a child's faith in the magic of Christmas, everyone in the squad with less than 3 Spirit is returned to 3 Spirit.
