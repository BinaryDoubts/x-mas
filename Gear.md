## Primary

### RuDOLF MR-24
**Damage** 3 / **Range** Far / **Fire Rate** SA / **Tags** Precise

*RuDOLF weapons are known for two things: their impeccable craftsmanship, and their overclocked RDG laser attachments. The Marksman-24 is no exception, a precise workhorse that shines in the hands of a skilled shooter.*
### RuDOLF AR-25
**Damage** 3 / **Range** Medium / **Fire Rate** FA / **Tags** Blinding

*A more aggressive version of the venerable MR-24, this AR-type platform sports an upgraded receiver and integrated recoil springs to handle fully automatic fire. The signature RDG laser has been reworked into a sidemount taclight, tuned for increased incandescence for closer-range encounters.*
### MnC Dasher SMG
**Damage** 3 / **Range** Medium / **Fire Rate** FA / **Tags** Lightweight

*The Dasher SMG is for operators who thrive in fast-paced battlezones, living up to MnC Foundry's unofficial motto: "Never Sit Still." Lightweight polyalloys and caseless ammunition make the gun's handling as agile as you are.*
### SanWor "Chimney" Shotgun
**Damage** 4 / **Range** Close / **Fire Rate** SA (Pump Action) / **Tags** Shredding

*The pump-action Chimney provides an up-armored version of SanWor's civilian "Bearclaw" shotgun. Originally used to drive off polar bears, this brutal weapon is loaded with shred-tinsel buckshot rounds, providing unparalleled firepower at knife-fight ranges.*
### SilverBell Drummerboy LMG
**Damage** 3 / **Range** Medium / **Fire Rate** FA / **Tags** Suppressive, Slow

*It's heavy as hell, looks like it's coated in chrome, and only fires 7.62×39mm FMJ rounds from a clunky drum mag. And yet, sometimes you need to absolutely saturate an area with fire, and when you do, you'll be glad you brought the Drummerboy.*
### Merry-1 Garland
**Damage** 3 / **Range** Medium / **Fire Rate** SA (Bolt Action) / **Tags** Bayonet, Reliable

*The Merry-1 is practically a museum piece, a classic bolt-action rifle dating back to the first Great Arctic War. Although it has been surpassed technologically, it's never been beaten when it comes to easy of use and durability. A small bell mounted by the clip ejection port gives its distinctive reload* ping *a festive touch.*
### MID/Winter Heavy-Draw Compound Bow
**Damage** 3 (Standard arrows), 2 Blast (Explosive arrows) / **Range** Medium / **Fire Rate** Single / **Tags** Silenced (Standard arrows), Precise

*Why bring a bow to a gunfight? A bow doesn't jam, doesn't break, doesn't give away your position, and if it's a MID/Winter design, it comes standard with explosive arrows.*
### CF-GHOST 567
**Damage** 2 AP / **Range** Medium / **Fire Rate** FA / **Tags** Silenced

*Designed as a speculative "concept weapon" by the CHRISTMAS FUTURE working group, a small number of real GHOST 567s were actually built. This burst-fire assault rifle uses subsonic armor-piercing flechettes and a high-tech integrated silencer to deliver near-silent kinetic payloads. Inaccurate at long range and less powerful than other AR platforms, the GHOST is built for operators comfortable with winning fights through subterfuge and strategy over brute force.*

## Secondary
### Desert Partridge .50CAL
**Damage** 2 / **Range** Close / **Fire Rate** SA / **Tags** Heavy, Slow

*They call this gun "The Mule" because it kicks like a, well, you get it. Less of a sidearm and more of a way of life, the Desert Partridge is a hand cannon with zero subtlety or restraint.*
### Silent Night 9mm
**Damage** 1 / **Range** Medium / **Fire Rate** SA / **Tags** Silenced, Lightweight

*The service sidearm of choice for ELF commandos, whisper-quiet and twice as deadly.*
### Merry-10 RF/PDW
**Damage** 1 / **Range** Close / **Fire Rate** FA / **Tags** Suppressive

*You can empty the Merry-10's mag in two seconds, and you'll be tempted to: this stripped-back machine pistol is easy on the eyes and easier in the hands.*
### SanWor "VIXEN" Combat Axe
**Damage** 3 AP / **Range** Melee (Close if thrown) / **Fire Rate** - / **Tags** Brutal

*Everyone carries a knife, but only the real badasses carry an axe. Razor-sharp for up-close hack-and-slash and light enough to throw halfway across the room into some guy's skull.*

## Heavy
### MISSILE-TOW Launcher
**Damage** 4 Blast / **Range** Medium (Far if locked on) / **Fire Rate** Single / **Tags** Vehicle Lock-On, Slow

*It's a man-portable mayhem machine designed for fire-and-forget demolitions. A CF-spec targeting chip means whether it flies or drives, your lock-on beep will be the last thing they hear.*
### COAL Ornament GL
**Damage** 3 Blast / **Range** Medium / **Fire Rate** FA / **Tags** Heavy, Arcing

*The COAL's lockwheel cylinder holds up to six ornament grenades at a time, each ready to deliver a bauble-fragmentation payload at a distance. Supports automatic cycling, which means you don't even have to let up on the trigger to fire all six shells at anything you want extremely dead.*
### Naughty List Riot Gun
**Damage** 5 / **Range** Close / **Fire Rate** FA / **Tags** Shredding, Heavy

*Naughty List makes big guns for bigger guys. Are you huge enough to carry a drum-fed automatic shotgun the size of a giant's fist?*
### Sinterklaas 12/NIGHT Icethrower
**Damage** 4 / **Range** Close / **Fire Rate** Continuous / **Tags** Brutal, Freezing

*Supercooled nitrogen delivered with stunning velocity inflicts 3rd degree frostbite at medium range and whole-body glaciation up close.*
### eggNOG Tippler HMG
**Damage** 4 / **Range** Medium / **Fire Rate** FA / **Tags** Suppressive, Heavy, Bipod

*Send lead downrange with more speed and volume than you thought possible. With the Tippler's belt-fed reciprocal receiver, you'll run out of enemies before you ever need to reload.*
### Arctic Warfare PM
**Damage** 6 AP / **Range** Far+ / **Fire Rate** SA / **Tags** Slow, Heavy, Bipod

*Calling this a sniper rifle is like calling a nuclear weapon a "big bomb." Technically accurate, but significantly undersells its preposterous killing power. This is a weapon that could punch a hole in God's head and still kill the guy standing behind him.*
