# Enlisting an Operator
M.A.S. Operators are the best of the best when it comes to full-spectrum holiday warfare. Follow the steps below to create your own elite defender of Christmas. *Sorry, no character sheets. Use a notepad or Notepad to record your stats and gear, just like our forefathers did.*

## Guy Type
To create a new operator, start by choosing a Type of Guy from the list below, or make up your own action movie archetype and note that down. *Your operator is definitely a "Guy," but they don't have to be a man.*

## What You're Up To
Two years ago, your operator's last mission with the M.A.S. (Merrymaking Activity Squad), went disastrously wrong. The team was disbanded and you've been in the wind ever since. Pick from the table below or decide for yourself what your character is doing during the opening getting-the-band-back-together montage.
