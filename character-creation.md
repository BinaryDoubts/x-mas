# Enlisting an Operator
M.A.S. Operators are the best of the best when it comes to full-spectrum holiday warfare. Follow the steps below to create your own elite defender of Christmas. *Sorry, no character sheets. Use a notepad or Notepad to record your stats and gear, just like our forefathers did.*

## Guy Type
To create a new operator, start by choosing a Type of Guy from the list below, or make up your own action movie archetype and note that down. *Despite the use of the term "Guy," your operator does not have to be a man.*
