## What Is This?
X-M.A.S. is a fast-paced action-movie roleplaying game about a team of elite Christmas operatives on a deadly mission to save Santa. Based on the FIST system, X-M.A.S. is optimized for quick play and merriment at your table. It's designed to be used alongside the [RED SLED DOWN](/x-mas/scenario) one-shot adventure, although the core rules can be used to play out any high-octane action story... as long as it's at least a little bit about saving Christmas.

Check out [character creation](/x-mas/character-creation) to make your own M.A.S. operator, or read the [rules](/x-mas/rules) to learn how to play. If you're running the game, you might also want to read the [adventure](/x-mas/scenario) and peek at the [timeline of events](/x-mas/timeline) leading up to the adventure's start.
